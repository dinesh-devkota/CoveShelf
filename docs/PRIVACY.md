# CoveShelf privacy policy

This policy applies to the official CoveShelf app. Independently modified or distributed
versions may behave differently.

## Your library and playback

CoveShelf connects directly to the network shares you configure. Library entries,
watched status, resume positions, and playback usage are stored locally on your device.
The official commercial version also stores local playback allowance information.
CoveShelf does not operate a user-account service or send your viewing history or
playback time to developer-operated servers. Local usage is not a cross-device profile.

NAS passwords and the optional TMDB API credential use the Keychain on Apple TV.
On Android, they are encrypted with a key held in the Android Keystore.
Media is read directly from your NAS for playback, not uploaded to a CoveShelf server.
Your NAS provider and network administrator may maintain their own connection logs.

## Optional metadata

If you configure a TMDB credential, CoveShelf sends movie search terms, identifiers,
and that credential to TMDB to obtain metadata. Artwork is downloaded from TMDB.
These requests disclose your network address to those services. TMDB's own
[privacy policy](https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy) governs its processing.
You can use your NAS library without configuring TMDB.
Photo files are read from your NAS for display and are not sent to TMDB for matching.

## Purchases

Apple processes App Store purchases, billing, and subscription management. CoveShelf
uses Apple's StoreKit framework to check purchase entitlements and restore purchases.
CoveShelf does not receive or store your payment-card details. Apple may retain
purchase history separately from the app's local library and usage data.
See [Apple's privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Control and retention

Library sources and individual entries can be managed in the app. Local files and
Keychain items have different system retention rules; removing an app does not
necessarily erase every Keychain item. App Store purchases can be restored using the
Apple Account that owns them. Removing CoveShelf does not cancel an Apple subscription;
manage subscriptions through your Apple Account settings.

## Questions

Contact the maintainer through the
[CoveShelf issue tracker](https://github.com/dinesh-devkota/mediavault/issues).
Do not post NAS addresses, passwords, API keys, purchase receipts, or private viewing
history in a public issue.
